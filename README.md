# MM2SF
This repository gathers the MM2SF code along with some instructions and readme files.

MM2SF is a simple code to create an optimum collection of Atom Centered Symmetry Functions (ACSFs) for a chemical system. The code uses a Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) to decompose the characteristic chemical space of a molecule, as provided by a molecular dynamics simulation or normal mode sampling, into well-defined clusters. Then the parameters of the symmetry functions are automatically selected to accurately describe each of the latter domains of the chemical space.
